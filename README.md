# Weather App

As per user's input for city name, App will fetch data from http://openweathermap.org/  to display city latest weather data.

Following data will display

- Weather description
- Current City Temprature
- Max/Min Temprature
- Pressure
- Humidity
- Icon as per weather report

Third party framwork: Alamofire

NOTE: As I am using free account for http://openweathermap.org/, it has limited access and each request needs to 10 mins pause time.
